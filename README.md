# Calculator_using_Tkinter
Created a basic usable calculator using Tkinter (Python)

Basically, Tkinter is the inbuilt python module that is used to create GUI applications. It is one of the most commonly used modules for creating GUI applications in Python as it is simple and easy to work with.

So, in this project after importing tkinter I add a basic entry box which is not too much fancy but it is workable, then I define some functionality like clickable "button" like '0-9', equal, clear with Operators like 'add', 'sub', 'mul', 'div'.
